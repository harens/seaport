## ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

Note that if installing from PyPi or building from source, [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) needs to already be installed, and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is required if using the `--pr` flag.

### Homebrew üç∫

Binary bottles are available for x86_64_linux, catalina and big_sur.

```
brew install harens/tap/seaport
```

### PyPi üêç

```
pip install seaport
```

## üíª Usage

```txt
> seaport --help
Usage: seaport [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Bumps the version number and checksum of a port.

  For more information, please visit https://github.com/harens/seaport

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  clip  Bumps the version number and checksum of NAME, and copies the
        result...

  pr    Bumps the version number and checksum of NAME, and sends a PR to...
```

### üìã `seaport clip NAME`

Copies the updated portfile to your clipboard

```txt
> seaport clip --help
üåä Starting seaport...
Usage: seaport clip [OPTIONS] NAME

  Bumps the version number and checksum of NAME, and copies the result to
  your clipboard.

Options:
  --bump TEXT               The new version number
  --test / --no-test        Runs port test
  --lint / --no-lint        Runs port lint --nitpick
  --install / --no-install  Installs the port and allows testing of basic
                            functionality

  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

#### üìõ `name` (_Required_)

The name of the port to update.

e.g. `seaport clip gping`

#### üîª `--bump TEXT`

Manually set the version number to bump it to. This should be in the same format as the output of the livecheck.

By default, it uses the value outputted from the livecheck.

This flag can be useful if there's no livecheck available or you want to override it.

e.g. `seaport clip gping --bump 1.2.0-post`

#### üß™ `--test / --no-test` (_default `--no-test`_)

Runs `sudo port test NAME` after updating the portfile.

e.g. `seaport clip py-rich --test`

#### ü§î `--lint / --no-lint` (_default `--no-lint`_)

Runs `port lint --nitpick NAME` after updating the portfile.

e.g. `seaport clip gping --lint`

#### üî® `--install / --no-install` (_default `--no-install`_)

Installs the port via the updated portfile and allows testing of basic functionality. After this has been completed, the port is uninstalled from the user's system.

e.g. `seaport clip gping --install`

### ‚úâÔ∏è `seaport pr NAME`

Sends a pull requrest to [macports/macports-ports](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports) with the updated portfile contents.

The flags in `clip` are also valid for this subcommand.

The pull request template is automatically filled in depending on what flags the command was run with (e.g. if `--lint` was used, this would be noted in the verification section of the template).

```txt
> seaport pr --help
üåä Starting seaport...
Usage: seaport pr [OPTIONS] NAME LOCATION

  Bumps the version number and checksum of NAME, and sends a PR to update
  it.

Options:
  --bump TEXT               The new version number
  --test / --no-test        Runs port test
  --lint / --no-lint        Runs port lint --nitpick
  --install / --no-install  Installs the port and allows testing of basic
                            functionality

  --new                     Send a PR from the local portfile repo
  --help                    Show this message and exit.
  ```

#### üó∫ `location` (_Required_)

Where to clone the macports-ports directory to.
Note that macports-ports should not be in the location (unless you want to clone the repo to a folder with that name)

It is recommended to set the direction to a directory that already contains the cloned repo to speed up the process.
However, if you do so, please make sure your master branch is clear and has upstream defined.

The following example would create the folder ~/GitHub/macports-ports, creating any subdirectories if they don't exist.
e.g. `seaport pr gping ~/GitHub/`
  
#### ‚úÖ `--new`

This flag is used if sending a PR for a new portfile from the user's [local portfile repo](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/development.local-repositories.html).

### üöÄ Use of sudo

Sudo is only required if `--test`, `--lint` or `--install` are specified, and it will be asked for during runtime. This is since the local portfile repo needs to be modified to be able to run the relevant commands.

Any changes made to the local portfile repo are reverted during the cleanup stage.
