Maintainer Notes
--------------------

ðŸ¥¾ Bumping Version Number
****************************

Have you updated the :code:`contributing.rst` file by cross-referencing with :code:`cz changelog`?

If so, run :code:`cz bump -s --increment LEVEL`, where LEVEL could be major, minor or patch.

Deploy to PyPi by running :code:`poetry build` and :code:`poetry publish`. Also update the Homebrew formula.

ðŸ“† Updating Copyright Year
****************************

As an example, running the below code block from the project root directory will update the copyright year from 2021 to 2022.
